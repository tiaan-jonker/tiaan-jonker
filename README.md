# Welcome, I'm Tiaan ðŸ‘‹

I recently graduated from [Dev Academys](https://devacademy.co.nz/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwgYSTBhDKARIsAB8Kuktbb0DWX4Q7kk5pH-HMplNUiMBA60xYTWzpVqCMnxMTEKjYY5zl0_waAg0aEALw_wcB) going through an intensive 15-week full-stack Bootcamp. I learned the following technologies and skills: 

- JavaScript 
- React and Redux
- Node.js and Express.js
- SQL using SQLite3 with Knex.js
- HTML5 and CSS3
- Pair programming
- Agile practices

Prior to entering the software development world I was an insurance broker and risk advisor where I worked with Kiwi business ranging from SMEs to NZX listed companies. Customer relationship and deep technical understanding of professional, liability and cyber risks with an appreciation and empathy for business ownersâ€™ concerns was key to success.

## Whats next? ðŸ¤–

I am looking for a full time software development role in Auckland, New Zealand. While I am equally confident with front and back-end development I enjoy front-end more.  

What I want to learn next are: 

- React Native
- TypeScript
- AWS

My personal portfolio is also on the way! ðŸš§
